Jeff Tweedy writes a lot of songs. Not even just a lot of songs, a lot of great songs. It's really incredible and admirable how much he accomplishes and how much fun he has doing it. His songs that aren't profound or philosophical are the ones that really stand out to me. They're mostly meaningless, but they don't sound dumb or cringy. How does he do it?!


Luckily he's open about his process and there's one process that stood out to me that I'd like to try and would be fun to try to implement programmatically. In short, Jeff will take two poems and swap either the nouns or the verbs and look for interesting phrases to use in songs. I think in his book he mentioned this is how he got the phrase "I assassin down the avenue."


I've really enjoyed working with serverless functions at work recently, so I'm going to consider trying them on Azure or Google Cloud for this, and maybe writing in Go.
