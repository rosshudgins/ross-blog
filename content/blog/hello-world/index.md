Intro post! At work I've historically been very much a full stack developer, but recently I've been working only on the backend. After reading a bunch of posts and listening to a bunch of podcasts I felt really encouraged to try out some new frameworks and tools that make use of React, since I haven't gotten to work with it professionally in a while.

Who knows what I'll end up using this for - maybe I'll come up with some business ideas, maybe this will be a sandbox to try some design or be a frontend for some interesting APIs?
